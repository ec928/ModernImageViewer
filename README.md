# 🚀 Modern Image Viewer (Public Beta)

A high-performance, hardware-accelerated image viewer built for creators, 3D artists, and power users. Designed specifically to handle massive directories of high-resolution images with zero UI lag and unique windowing capabilities.

## ✨ Key Features

**Tear-Off Viewports** — Instantly detach any image into its own borderless, floating window. Ideal for secondary monitors, or overlaying reference images while working in Blender, Photoshop, or AI tools.

**GPU-Accelerated Rendering** — Powered by Win2D (Direct2D) for near-instant rendering and smooth scaling, offloading heavy image decoding to the graphics card.

**Massive Folder Support** — A tiered-decoding architecture allows seamless browsing of folders containing thousands of high-resolution (10 MB+) images without stuttering or unbounded memory growth. Preview, display, and high-fidelity tiers are capped (see `ARCHITECTURE.md`).

**Native Windows 11 Design** — Built on the Windows App SDK (WinUI 3) for a clean, modern aesthetic with Mica material and native OS performance.

**Collage and Cinematic (beta)** — In-app collage editor, and a cinematic slideshow whose show you can edit: reorder, hide and duplicate slides, hold a Ken Burns move on one slide, and save or reload the show. These are still being hardened; save often.

HEIC/HEIF and AVIF need the corresponding Windows codecs installed. If a file will not open, the viewer shows a short HUD message rather than a blank canvas.

## 🛠 Technical Stack

| | |
|---|---|
| Framework | C# / .NET 8 |
| UI | WinUI 3 (Windows App SDK) |
| Graphics | Win2D (Direct2D) |
| Architecture | Asynchronous tiered decoding with reference-counted GPU resources for VRAM efficiency |

Supported formats: JPEG, PNG, BMP, GIF, WebP, HEIC/HEIF, AVIF.

## 📦 Installation (Portable)

Distributed as a self-contained portable app — no installation or registry changes are required.

1. Download the latest `.zip` from the [Releases](https://github.com/ec928/ModernImageViewer/releases) page.
2. Extract the folder to your preferred location.
3. Run `ModernImageViewer.exe`.

**Windows SmartScreen**: because this is an unsigned indie beta, Windows Defender may flag it. Click **More info → Run anyway** to launch. This is standard for indie software that has not been signed with an expensive corporate certificate. You can verify the safety of the application by reviewing the source code provided in this repository.

## 🔨 Building from Source

Requires the .NET 8 SDK and the Windows App SDK workload (Visual Studio 2022, "Windows application development").

```
git clone https://github.com/ec928/ModernImageViewer.git
cd ModernImageViewer
dotnet build -c Release -p:Platform=x64
```

To produce a portable build, run `publish.bat`. It wraps the same publish profile Visual Studio uses, then sanity-checks the output and launches the result briefly to confirm it starts.

```
publish.bat            # publish, then smoke-test
publish.bat nosmoke    # publish only
```

Exit codes: `0` success, `1` publish failed, `2` output looks wrong, `3` app crashed on launch.

> `publish.bat` is the supported ship path (relative output under `bin\x64\Release`). Visual Studio `.pubxml` files now use the same relative `PublishDir`. Pass an extra folder argument to `publish.bat` if you want a different destination.

> Deliberately **not** published as a single file. Single-file self-extracts ~277 MB to `%TEMP%` on the first launch after every publish, measured at ~2.8 s to first window versus ~1.5 s for loose files.

## ⌨️ Shortcuts

| | |
|---|---|
| **Alt** (hold) | Peek at the sidebar; it closes when you let go |
| **F11** | Fullscreen |
| **← / →** | Previous / next image |
| **Home / End** | First / last image |
| **Delete** | Send to the Recycle Bin |
| **Esc** | Close the preview |

The sidebar also opens when the pointer reaches the left edge. Alt works whether or not an image is open, so you can jump folders without leaving the viewer.

## 💬 Feedback

This is an active public beta. If you encounter bugs, performance issues, or have feature requests, please open a ticket in the [Issues](https://github.com/ec928/ModernImageViewer/issues) tab — or use **Report a problem** in the app's About dialog, which opens the same place.
